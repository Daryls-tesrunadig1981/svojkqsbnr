Just walked out of the theater, still trying to shake off the digital dust from my brain. The Electric State — it's like it reached inside, toggled my neurons or something. You know, that feeling you get when you realize you're out of popcorn halfway through because you were too entranced or confused or both to stop munching? Yeah, that was me. 

The screen's glow still feels like it's bouncing around in my eyes. Some kid down the row wouldn’t stop crinkling the foil on his candy, so I missed part of that scene where the sky was on fire, or was it the cars blowing up? Either way, chaos seemed kind of quiet, like it melted into the background hum of everyone just staring, jaws slightly apart. The whole thing felt like my old iPhone when it freaks out in the middle of an update — that kind of beautiful glitch.

> There was this moment, this driving sequence, right? Felt like dune buggies zip-zapping through forgotten dreams, the road like it's made out of melting VHS tapes. And you can practically taste the pixels. Honestly, I half-expected to see a rebooting Windows logo float by.

Characters feel like they're sculpted out of nostalgia and anxiety. They move like ghosts who binge-𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 whole 𝘴𝘦𝘢𝘴𝘰𝘯s of existential dread on 𝘕𝘦𝘵𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘹. Pacing's a fever dream; you're either basking in the glow or scrambling to tuck necklace chains back under your collar, all awkward like. Someone once said I needed to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for a re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩... and now I get it. Might even go through the struggle of figuring out where to do that legally, heh.

Soundtrack was like... imagine if your old stereo got drunk and started belting out '80s synth tunes, crashing into old voicemail messages on full blast. My ears are still buzzing. And the couple next to me whispering felt like background dialogue... really meta.

𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if you get the chance. But also, maybe, don't if you treasure your concept of what a road trip means. Now, I remember someone said to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , so listen or don’t. Anyway, no promises you’ll come out less scrambled than satellite TV in the nineties.

Okay, let me check my tabs real quick.

Just kidding, that makes no sense. Neither did parts of the  , in the best way possible.
